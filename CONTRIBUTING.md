# :wave: Hello
> **Note**
> This documentation and repo is providing resources for adorsys internal usage.

Here is a styleguide/introduction of how adorsys employees should contribute to
this repository.

## :computer: Client Setup
We are requiring a certain client setup to contribute:
* CodeSigning needs to be enabled  
  You should sign your commits either with SSH or GPG Keys. Good Resources are:
  * [Sign with ssh](https://calebhearth.com/sign-git-with-ssh)
  * [Why you should sign](https://withblue.ink/2020/05/17/how-and-why-to-sign-git-commits.html)
  * [Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits)
* You should have a adorsys.com email adress verified in your account
* You need to have 2FA enabled

## Workflow
* We want everything documented in GH issues
* The `main` branch is protected and you need to create Branches/PRs on that.
* Commits should reference an issue, describing more to the problem.
